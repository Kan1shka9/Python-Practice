>>> text.split()
['this', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'statement']
>>>
>>> text = "this is a sample, statement with, a comma"
>>> text.split(",")
['this is a sample', ' statement with', ' a comma']

Substitution

1.) Format with Keyword Arguments (Variables)

4/7/2017
>>>
>>> text = today.strftime('%-m/%-d/%y')
>>> print text
4/7/17
>>>
>>> now = datetime.datetime.utcnow() #utc time
>>> text = now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f')[:-3]
>>> print text
2017-04-07 21:59:31.479
>>>
>>> now = datetime.datetime.now() #local time
>>> date_text = now.strftime('%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S.%f') #[:-3]
>>> text = "Time is: %s" %(date_text)
>>> print text
Time is: 2017/04/07 14:59:45.703152
